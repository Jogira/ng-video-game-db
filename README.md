# Zweiton VideoGame db
A web app following a tutorial from "Code with Sloba" that was created using Angular in conjunction with a free use video game database API from here: https://rawg.io/apidocs

The games are automatically populated using an API call.

The database can be sorted using the dropdown and selecting a filter. In this screenshot, I sort by the game's rating.

"Ocarina of Time" comes back as the first entry and can be clicked to view more details about the game.

It has a near perfect score from Metacritic. The description and number of likes or dislikes can be viewed from here.

If screenshots or trailers are available, they will also be displayed here dynamically.

Here is another screenshot from GTA V's description page, showing off when there are trailers available from the API as well.

Games can also be searched for by name using the search bar.
